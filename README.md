# Tic Tac Toe
This Java code creates a simple Tic Tac Toe game. The game works by prompting a user for their name, and for the desired dimension of the board. The game then proceeds by asking the player their move. The game finishes when either the player, or the computer completes a line of their characters. The Java version plays you vs an AI computer.
The initial Python version is more simple, and allows for two players to play a local version.
