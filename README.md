# Simple Retro Games

The aim of this repository is to collect several collections of basic games made using python.

So far, the repo contains Tic Tac Toe. The next goal is to update Tic Tac Toe with an AI player, and then to add a simple game of "Snake", and a simple version of "Connect Four".

# Tic Tac Toe
This Python code creates a simple Tic Tac Toe game using base functions. We utilize list comprehensions to check for winners, and we use exception handling to ensure valid inputs.
